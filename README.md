Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dristen. I've always been interested in programming, and finally gave it a real shot at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. I tried a variety of languages and frameworks, and ultimately landed on JavaScript/NextJS as my weapon of choice.

I set myself the goal of launching my first fullstack app this year, and have already made some huge (by my terms ðŸ˜‚) progress. I look forward to seeing where it goes and to continue expanding my knowledge. ðŸŒŒ
